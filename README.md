# CNN for Rock-Paper-Scissors Classification

This repository contains the project for the "Statistical Methods for Machine Learning" course at the University of Milan. The project involves a systematic study of building, training, and evaluating a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of Rock-Paper-Scissors hand gestures.

## Project Overview

This project follows a rigorous methodology to explore the development of a robust image classifier. Key steps include:
- A systematic progression through three CNN models of increasing complexity to analyze the bias-variance trade-off.
- The application of regularization techniques (Dropout and Data Augmentation) to mitigate overfitting.
- A final, unbiased evaluation on a held-out test set, achieving **97.7% accuracy**.
- An optional generalization test on custom images to investigate the model's robustness to domain shift.

The complete methodology, analysis, and conclusions are detailed in the accompanying paper, `RPS-Paper.pdf`.
